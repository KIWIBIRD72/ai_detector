The cruise ship was off to the left. The area with all the boxes was on the right,
surrounded by a chain-link fence topped with razor wire. I drove around one time
on the access road, wrestling a rising tide of certainty and a swelling chorus of
what sounded like college fight songs from the Dark Passenger. The road dead-
ended at a guard booth well before I got to the containers. There was a gate with
several uniformed gentlemen lounging about, and no way through without
answering some fairly embarrassing questions. Yes, officer, I wondered if I could
come in and look around? You see, I thought it might be a good place for a friend
of mine to slice up my sister.
I cut through a line of orange cones in the middle of the road thirty feet from the
gate and turned around, back the way I had come. The cruise ship loomed on the
right now. I turned left just before I came to the bridge back to the mainland and
drove into a large area with a terminal on one end and a chain-link fence on the
other. The fence was gaily decorated with signs that threatened dire punishment
to anyone who strayed into the area, signed by U.S. Customs.
The fence led back to the main road along a large parking lot, empty at this time
of night. I cruised its perimeter slowly, staring at the containers on the far side.
These would be from foreign ports, needing to go through customs, access tightly
controlled. It would be much too difficult for anyone to get in and out of this area,
especially if they were carrying questionable loads of body parts and the like. I
would either need to find a different area or admit that chasing vague feelings
dredged up from a series of taunting dreams and a scantily clad doll was a waste
of time. And the sooner I admitted that, the better my chance of finding Deb. She
was not here. There was no reason she should be.
